"""Skill orchestration.

``run_skill()`` is the single entry point for invoking an AI skill.
It loads the skill, expands any ``{{skills_menu}}`` placeholder in the
system prompt, assembles the user message from the collectors named in
``requires_context``, calls the AI, and parses the response according
to the skill's ``output_contract``.

All AI and configuration errors are caught and returned as
``SkillResult(success=False, ...)`` so callers don't have to wrap the
call in try/except.
