"""Retirement detection for OpenStack projects.

This module detects retired upstream projects using:
1. Primary (authoritative): openstack/project-config gerrit/projects.yaml
   - Projects with description starting with "RETIRED" are retired
2. Fallback (inference): openstack/releases data
   - If a project is not seen in releases for >= 3 cycles, mark as possibly_retired

The module also handles mapping Ubuntu source package names to upstream
project identifiers (e.g., "glance" -> "openstack/glance").
