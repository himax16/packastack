"""Implementation of subset build commands (libraries, clients, and services).

Provides functionality for building specific subsets of OpenStack packages:
- `packastack build libraries`: Build oslo libraries and other library packages
- `packastack build clients`: Build Python client packages
- `packastack build services`: Build core service packages (nova, glance, etc.)
