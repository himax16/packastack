"""Implementation of the build-rc command.

Discovers all OpenStack packages that have a release candidate (RC) release
for the current development series, and builds them using the build-all
infrastructure.

Usage::

    packastack build-rc              # Build all RC packages for devel series
    packastack build-rc --dry-run    # Show which packages have RC releases
    packastack build-rc --ppa-upload # Build and upload to PPA
    packastack build-rc --no-ai      # Build without AI diagnosis
