       - If watch_config.fallback_for_not_in_releases, use debian/watch + uscan

    3. POST-FINAL series:
       - Any project with release: RELEASE (POST_FINAL_RELEASE)
       - No release: SNAPSHOT (PRE_FINAL_NO_RELEASE) [rare edge case]

    4. PRE-FINAL series with beta/RC/final release:

        cycle_stage: Pre-computed cycle stage.
        force_snapshot: Force snapshot mode.
        package_status: Status of package (active, new, defunct).
        packaging_repo: Optional path to packaging repo for watch file access.
        watch_config: Optional watch/uscan configuration.
        uscan_cache: Optional dict for caching uscan results.
