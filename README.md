# Packastack

Packastack is a small CLI tool to assist with building OpenStack packages for Ubuntu.

## Requirements

Packastack targets an **Ubuntu host** and drives the standard Debian packaging toolchain. Install the system packages before first use:

```bash
sudo apt install git git-buildpackage devscripts dpkg-dev sbuild schroot gnupg
sudo sbuild-adduser $USER   # then log out/in (or `newgrp sbuild`) for group membership to apply
```

`git`, `gbp`, `dch`, and `dpkg-source` are required for source builds; `sbuild`/`schroot` are needed for binary builds (the default) and `gnupg` for signature verification. Missing tools are reported with install hints when you run a build.

Python 3.14+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are used for the Python side:

```bash
sudo snap install astral-uv --classic   # or see uv's install docs
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MylesJP/packastack.git
cd packastack
uv sync
```

Run the CLI through uv from the repo checkout:

```bash
uv run packastack --help
```

Or install it as a tool so `packastack` is on your PATH:

```bash
uv tool install .
packastack --help
```

## First use

```bash
# 1. One-time setup: writes ~/.config/packastack/config.yaml, creates caches
#    under ~/.cache/packastack, and clones the OpenStack releases metadata.
packastack init            # add --prime to also fetch Ubuntu archive indexes now

# 2. Refresh Ubuntu archive package indexes (also refreshed on demand by builds).
packastack refresh

# 3. Build a package. Schroots are created automatically on first build
#    (requires sudo). The host architecture is used.
packastack build nova --ubuntu-series noble
```

Build artifacts and logs land under `~/.cache/packastack/build/<package>/<build-id>/`, and built packages are published to the local APT repository at `~/.cache/packastack/apt-repo`.

Resume an interrupted build by reusing a previous workspace:

```bash
packastack build cinder --resume                          # latest build
packastack build cinder --resume-build 20260210-143022    # specific build
```

## Development

Install dependencies and run tests using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync              # Install dependencies
uv run packastack init  # Initialize Packastack
```

Testing, formatting, linting, and type checking are automated via `tox`:

```bash
tox               # Run all default envs (pytest, fmt, mypy)
tox -e fmt        # Auto-format and auto-fix lint issues
tox -e pep8       # Check-only (CI gate, no modifications)
tox -e mypy       # Type checking
tox -e unit       # Run tests
tox -e cover      # Tests with full coverage report
```

See `tox.ini` and `pyproject.toml` for configuration details.

## Commands

- `packastack init` — initialize configuration and cache directories, clone OpenStack releases, and optionally prime Ubuntu archive metadata (`--prime`).
- `packastack refresh` — fetch and cache Packages.gz indexes from an Ubuntu archive mirror, respecting TTL and offline mode.
- `packastack build <package>` — build a package (and optionally its dependencies with `--build-deps`, or everything with `--all`).
- `packastack plan <package>` — show the validated build plan without building.
- `packastack clean` — inspect and manage local cache state.

### Subset builds

Three special package names build an entire class of managed packages in one command. Each discovers all packages, classifies them from the OpenStack releases metadata, and builds the matching set in dependency order using the same infrastructure as `build --all` (including `--parallel`, `--keep-going`, and `--dry-run`):

- `packastack build libraries` — all library packages: Oslo and other shared libraries **plus** the Python client libraries.
- `packastack build clients` — only the Python client libraries (`python-novaclient`, `python-glanceclient`, and friends).
- `packastack build services` — only the core services (nova, glance, neutron, cinder, keystone, ...).

A typical release workflow builds `libraries` first so the local APT repo can satisfy service build-dependencies, then `services`:

```bash
packastack build libraries --ubuntu-series noble
packastack build services --ubuntu-series noble
```

Use `--dry-run` to list what a subset would build without building it. Related: `packastack build rc` (or `rc1`, `rc2`, ...) builds all packages with a matching release-candidate release.

See `packastack <command> --help` for full flags, `pyproject.toml` for development dependencies and test configuration, and [docs/](docs/) for the full documentation.

## AI-Powered Build Diagnosis (build-doctor)

Packastack ships an AI-assisted triage system called **build-doctor**. When an sbuild fails and an API key is configured, build-doctor inspects the log, picks the best specialist skill for the failure shape, and either produces a validated patch or explains what the maintainer needs to do. AI features are opt-in and non-blocking: if the API call fails, you get the normal failure output. See [docs/reference/config.rst](docs/reference/config.rst) for configuration and [docs/explanation/ai-skills.rst](docs/explanation/ai-skills.rst) for the architecture.

### How it works

build-doctor is a deterministic Python dispatcher plus pluggable **skills** on disk. Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, output contract, trigger regexes) and a prompt body. The dispatcher:

1. Extracts the failure section from the sbuild log.
2. Tries a cheap regex pass over every skill's `triggers.log_patterns`. A match routes directly — no router call.
3. Otherwise asks the `build-doctor` router skill to pick a specialist. The router returns a structured dispatch payload with a confidence score, evidence lines, and optional fallbacks.
4. Validates the pick against a confidence threshold (default 0.5, configurable) and the installed skill registry; walks the fallback chain if needed; drops to the generic `build-patch` skill as a last resort.
5. Runs the chosen specialist, parses its response against its declared output contract, validates any patch with `git apply --check` (with one correction retry via the `patch-correction` skill), and commits the result.

**Adding a new failure-class handler is a folder drop** — no Python changes. Drop `src/packastack/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in place (or point `PACKASTACK_SKILLS_DIR` at a dev copy), and the router picks it up at next run.

### Skills shipped today

| Skill | Output | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `build-doctor` | dispatch | Router — picks the specialist |
| `build-patch` | patch | Generic patch author; safe fallback |
| `patch-diagnosis` | diagnosis | Decides whether an existing quilt patch can be dropped (already upstream?) |
| `patch-refresh` | patch | Refreshes fuzzy patches after upstream drift, including `setup.cfg` → `pyproject.toml` migrations |
| `patch-correction` | patch | Fixes a patch that failed `git apply --check` |
| `python-compat` | patch | Handles interpreter bumps (distutils/imp/cgi removed, `ast.Str` → `Constant`, `asyncio.coroutine` removed, etc.) |
| `library-sync-advisor` | guidance | Detects stale oslo / python-\*client / stevedore / keystoneauth1 dependencies and advises a library sync instead of a patch |

### What it handles well today

- **Python interpreter bumps** — routed to `python-compat`, which knows the common removed-stdlib replacements.
- **Fuzzy quilt patches** — routed to `patch-refresh`; produces an updated patch against current upstream.
- **Upstreamed patches** — `patch-diagnosis` + auto-drop: removes the file, updates `debian/patches/series`, and commits.
- **Stale dependencies** — `library-sync-advisor` explicitly refuses to patch and tells you which src:package to sync.
- **Retry with memory** — failed attempts are saved to `ai-memory.json` in the run directory so subsequent builds can tell skills what was already tried.

### Current limitations

| Gap | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **No `debian/` file edits** | Skills are restricted to upstream-source patches; changing `debian/control`, `debian/rules`, or `debian/changelog` requires a human. |
| **No build-dep auto-resolution** | A skill can diagnose "missing libfoo-dev" via guidance, but cannot install or add it to `Build-Depends`. |
| **Single patch-and-rebuild cycle** | One retry per build; a second failure saves memory and exits. |
| **No multi-arch awareness** | Arch-specific fixes need human review. |
| **No interactive approval** | Valid patches are applied automatically; no preview step. |
| **No API retry or cost tracking** | Single HTTP call per skill invocation; transient failures are not retried. |
| **`extra_files_needed` parsed but unused** | The router can ask for additional context, but the runner doesn't yet re-run with it. |

### Roadmap

1. **Eval fixtures** — a corpus of real failed sbuild logs with expected router picks to guard routing quality as skills multiply.
2. **Consume `extra_files_needed`** — when the router asks for `debian/patches/series` etc., re-run with them instead of guessing.
3. **`ai capture` CLI** — snapshot a triage run into a fixture directory.
4. **More specialists** — `dep-gate` (guidance for dependencies not landed yet), `packaging-advisor` (structural shifts like eventlet removal).
5. **Approval mode** — pause before applying AI changes so operators can review.
6. **`debian/` file skills** — let specialists emit `debian/control` / `debian/rules` edits behind an explicit opt-in.
